# Pytorch TVM Extension

## Build

You'll need to build PyTorch on top of this PR: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/18846
```
cd pytorch
git fetch origin pull/18846/head:tvm_dev
git checkout tvm_dev
python setup.py install
```

Then, you'll need to build this repo seperately
```
# Make sure the right llvm-config is in your PATH
python setup.py install
```

## Test

```
python test/operators.py
```

## Code Layout

- `register.cpp`: Sets up pybind bindings and invokes the registration of a TVM backend.
- `compiler.{h,cpp}`: Main logic to compile a PyTorch JIT graph with TVM.
- `operators.{h,cpp}`: Location of mapping from JIT IR to TVM operators.

## TODO

- Add ability to register translations from opaque op names to TVM (as is done in `operator.cpp`) from Python.
- Zero copy `set_input`.

- Allocator
